# Coding Quiz

## Description

A quiz made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Questions are related to javascript theoretical knowledge so a young developer can test their knowledge and prepare for a interview.

### What was done?

I've created 4 pages in HTML:
- Main page: Where you can read the rules and start the game;
- Quiz page: Where you'll see the questions;
- Save page: Where you can see your score and add your name;
- High Score page: Where you'll see your score compared with other times you played.

To style those pages, a css was also created.

I've also created 3 js files so the page could work properly.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

When you click Start Quiz, you'll be redirected to the first question and the timer will start. You'll have 60 seconds to answer 5 questions.
For each answer you get right, you'll score 20 points. For each answer you get wrong, you'll loose 10 seconds.
When you finish the 5 questions or when you run out of time, game is over and you'll see your score.
Add your initials and you'll receive a high score list.
Good luck!
